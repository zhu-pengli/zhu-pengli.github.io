#### About

I am currently a Research Staff with the Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong. Before that, I obtained the B.Eng., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees from Dalian Maritime University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yancheng Liu](https://ai.dlmu.edu.cn/info/1701/2021.htm) and [Prof. Siyuan Liu](https://mec.dlmu.edu.cn/info/1115/5789.htm). From 2023 to 2024, I was supported by [China Scholarship Council](https://www.csc.edu.cn/) as a Joint-Training Ph.D. Student with Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Anqi Qiu](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/bme/staff/dr-qiu-anqi/). 

#### Research

My current research focuses on medical image analysis, particularly in developing deep learning models for medical image synthesis, noise correction, and quality assessment. I explore generative frameworks such as conditional diffusion models and attention-based networks to address challenges in unpaired data settings and complex image representations. Previously, I worked extensively on underwater vision, including unsupervised image enhancement and perception-driven control of autonomous vehicles. I have published 20+ peer-reviewed papers in international journals and conferences, and have been granted several patents in these areas.
